Title: Google Spreadsheet Integration

Developers: Arun Nagarajan from Google and Daniel McLaughlin from the Boston Globe

Description: Easily search and process petition data directly through Google Spreadsheets. This tool could be a framework to exploring other open APIs within an environment familiar to many researchers and journalists.

Code is very early and cleanup/refactoring needed ;)
