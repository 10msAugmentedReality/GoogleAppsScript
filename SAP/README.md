SAP Demos
================

Sample SAP integrations. You'll need to create a [sample SAP account](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-40986) at the SCN.

You can watch the video of the [sample demos here](http://www.slideshare.net/SAPAppsPartner/tehcnical-webinar-technical-webinar-building-mashups-with-google-apps-and-sap-using-sap-netweaver-gateway) (start at about 1 hr in for Google Apps demos)

These are not official Google samples. These are more of proof of concepts to support demos and other presentations. 

Please use this code as a guidline and not as production ready code.
